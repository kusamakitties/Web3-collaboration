# Kusama Kitties

## Project Description

Kusama Kitties is a dApp game for people to play with breedable and collectible kitties.
A parachain will be built and deployed on Kusama Network.
A web UI will de implemented to allow people to use it to interact with the parachain to play the game.

This project will also serve a purpose of an example of how to build a proper production ready parachian. I will be making a Substrate development online course to teach developers how this project is built.

A MVP version is hosted at https://xlc.github.io/kitties-ui/#/kitties
